# madameSow.github.io
Activity from my first class with the Black+ Google Developer Program.

I was tasked with creating a simple website with HTML using a template. I changed the background to my favorite colors
and I added one of my favorite GIFs that also embodies how I feel right now as a fellow in the inaugural class of this
wonderful prgram. This is my first time posting code to Github, so I am pretty excited.
